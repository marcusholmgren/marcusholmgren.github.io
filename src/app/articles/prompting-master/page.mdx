*Based on Anthropic's Expert Workflows*

Use this document as a guide to structure your interactions with LLMs. For complex problems, move through these stages sequentially.

## 1. The Context Layer (Memory Injection)

**Goal:** Establish a permanent "vibe" and technical baseline so you don't repeat yourself.

* **When to use:** At the very start of a new project or chat thread.
* **Template:**

> "You are my **[Role]**. Remember these preferences: **[Preference 1]**, **[Preference 2]**, and **[Preference 3]**. Acknowledge these and apply them to all future responses in this thread."

---

## 2. The Discovery Phase (Reverse Prompting)

**Goal:** Prevent the AI from guessing. Force it to audit your requirements first.

* **When to use:** Before you let the AI start a complex task (coding, strategy, writing).
* **Template:**

> "I need to **[Goal]**. Before you begin, ask me **[Number]** clarifying questions about my **[Dataset/Context/Outcome]**. Do not start the task until I have answered these questions."

---

## 3. The Multi-Expert Audit (Role Stacking)

**Goal:** Eliminate bias and catch blind spots by simulating a panel of experts.

* **When to use:** High-stakes decision making or analyzing a strategy.
* **Template:**

> "Analyze **[Topic/Problem]** from three perspectives simultaneously:
> 1. **[Expert Role 1 - e.g., Critical Skeptic]**
> 2. **[Expert Role 2 - e.g., Creative Optimist]**
> 3. **[Expert Role 3 - e.g., Practical Implementation Lead]**
> Show all three viewpoints and where they conflict."
>

## 4. The Execution Chain (Constraint Cascade)

**Goal:** Prevent "model fatigue" by breaking the task into logical, progressive steps.

* **When to use:** For long-form content, complex code, or deep research.
* **Template:**

> * **Step 1:** "First, **[Simple Task]**. Wait for my response."
> * **Step 2:** "Now that you've done that, **[Add Complexity/Layer]**."
> * **Step 3:** "Finally, **[Final Polish/Output Format]**."
>
>

## 5. The Quality Gate (Verification Loop)

**Goal:** Self-correction. Force the AI to find its own mistakes before you have to.

* **When to use:** For anything that requires high accuracy (math, code, logic).
* **Template:**

> "Complete **[Task]**. Once finished, identify 3 potential bugs, logical fallacies, or edge cases in your own work. Then, provide an updated version that resolves those issues."
