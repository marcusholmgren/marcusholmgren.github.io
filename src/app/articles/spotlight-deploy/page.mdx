[GitHub Pages got a refresh](https://youtube.com/shorts/Kq28yBigDYw?feature=share) and now have built in support for deploying several of the most popular static site generators, like NextJS.
Since IÂ´m using Tailwind UIÂ´s [Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight) template for this blog. I thought I would setup a GitHub Action that would handle the build and publication of this blog. Easy peasy, right?
Well, not quite. One problem is that the Spotlight template uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) to render articles. Default Next.js does not know how to handle MDX files.

## How to fix it

Open your GitHub Actions workflow file and uncomment or remove the `Setup Pages` step. Because it will break the build and the MDX support.

```yaml
- name: Setup Pages
  uses: actions/configure-pages@v2
  with:
      # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable
      # server side image optimization (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized).
      #
      # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
      static_site_generator: next
```

Next you need to open `next.config.mjs` and turn of the `images` optimization. Because GitHub Pages does not have support to run this feature

```js
{...,
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}
```

After these changes the GitHub Actions should build and deploy your site.  ðŸŽ‰
