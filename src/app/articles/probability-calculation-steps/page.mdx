### Probability Calculation Steps

1. **Specify the Sample Space (Ω):** Identify all possible outcomes of the experiment.
2. **Specify the Probability Law:** Define the probability for each outcome or region of the sample space, ensuring the axioms are satisfied (nonnegativity, normalization, and additivity).
3. **Identify the Event of Interest (A):** Translate the verbal description of the problem into a mathematical subset of the sample space.
4. **Decompose or Partition (The "Missing" Step):**
    * For **discrete** spaces: Break the event into disjoint outcomes to use **Additivity**.
    * For **complex** events: Use **Conditioning** or the **Total Probability Theorem** to simplify the event into manageable pieces.
    * For **continuous** spaces: Define the boundaries of the event for integration (or geometric area).
5. **Calculate:** Sum the probabilities of the outcomes in the event or calculate the relevant integral/area.

### Why the "Decomposition" Step is Crucial

When tackling probability problems, the "Decomposition" step is often the foundation for success.  It's the process of breaking down a complex situation into smaller, more manageable parts.

* **Counting:** If all outcomes are equally likely, this step involves using Permutations or Combinations to find |A| and |Ω|.
* **Sequential Models:** If the experiment has stages, you use the **Multiplication Rule** or a tree diagram to find the probability of each path before summing them.
