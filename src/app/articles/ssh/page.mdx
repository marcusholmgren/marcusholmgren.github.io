## Create cryptographically strong SSH key

Create a new pair of public and private SSH keys

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Next open up your public SSH key and change the last section to a memorable name. The last part is treated as a comment.

```bash
code ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

---

## Copy SSH key to a server

Copy your public SSH key to a remote server for authentication

```bash
ssh-copy-id root@<ip-address>
```

Next enter the password for the account that you are adding SSH authentication to.
After this you should be able to authenticate to the server without providing a password.


## SSH into a remote machine


```bash
ssh -p <port-number> -i <path-to-ssh-keys> root@<ip-address>
```


Running a one off command on the remote machine

```bash
ssh root@<ip-address> hostname
```

 ## SSH config

 Simplify connections with SSH config files

 Add `~/.ssh/config` file

 ```bash
 Host foo
     HostName 127.0.0.1
     User root
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     Port 22
 ```

 Now you can SSH with `ssh foo` and that will use your configured values.
